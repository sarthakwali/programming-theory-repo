Basic Git workflow:

Clone repo ->
Create a branch (git branch branch-name) ->
Change HEAD (current branch) from master branch to created branch (git checkout branch-name) ->
Make changes on local system inside branch ->
Change HEAD (current branch) to master branch (git checkout main) -> 
Merge branch with master (git merge branch-name) ->
Stage changes (git add.) ->
Commit changes (git commit -m "Commit message") ->
Push changes (git push origin main)
